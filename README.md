## Github pages for Docs

We use [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
to create a static site for our documentation.

### Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll

Check the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
on how to setup Jekyll locally

Then from the root folder run the command

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will build and serve the site locally.
